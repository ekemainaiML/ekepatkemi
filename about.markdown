  <h3 style="text-align: center;">MACHINE LEARNING DEVELOPER || FULLSTACK MOBILE DEVELOPER</h3>
  <p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">As a seasoned Machine Learning Developer, I have extensive experience in data analytics, inferential statistics,
    probability theory, and the entire lifecycle of ML/DL model development, including MLOps. My expertise spans 
    supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. I’m proficient 
    with industry-leading libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Hugging Face.</p>

  <p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">I also bring a strong background in software development, which enhances my ability to serve ML models on-premise,
    across cloud platforms like Azure, AWS, Railway (PAAS), Replicate, and IBM Cloud, or as consumable APIs. Additionally, my software 
    development skills cover Android app development, multiplatform development using Flutter and Kotlin 
    Multiplatform Mobile (KMM), as well as API and microservices development and deployment through Azure, Nginx, and 
    various cloud platforms.</p>

  <p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">As a Kaggle ML Developer, I actively participate in machine learning competitions, contributing to real-world 
    problems by applying advanced algorithms, data pre-processing techniques, and model tuning strategies. Through Kaggle,
    I’ve honed my skills in feature engineering, ensemble methods, and model optimization in challenging domains such as 
    image classification, text analysis, and tabular data predictions, which have significantly improved my practical 
    ML experience. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ekeministephen">See my Kaggle profile here.</a></p>
