<body class="resume-body">
<div style='text-align: justify;'>

<ol class="resume-list1" style="list-style-type: none">
<li> Design of Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for controlling the Speed of DC Motor On-Load: A Case Study of the Lube-Oil Pump Motor of the H25 Hitachi Gas Turbine Generator at Bonny Oil and Gas Terminal. Achievement: Developed FLC controller for stepping up and stabilizing the speed of the motor which had already started going down without outright need for replacement of the motor.</li>
<li> Design and implementation of belt conveyor lines speed synchronizer (PID) and Supervisory Controller for industrial applications, a case study of Champion’s Brewery, Uyo. Achievement: A new supervisory control was developed with local materials and integrated into the company’s existing manufacturing line which lowers production time per product, resulting in increased turnover.</li>
<li> Data-Driven modeling of Natural Gas Dew Point from a Molecular Sieve Dehydration Bed using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and System Identification. Achievement: Developed an ANFIS model for the client; they used the same to predict system yield and consequently made informed management decisions on performance and safety of the Molecular Sieve Dehydration Bed.</li>
<li> Model-Based Design (MBD) of wind turbine: design included turbine blades, nacelle, pitch controller, yaw controller, supervisory controller, and generator and transmission grid. Achievement: Developed a virtual model for an academic consulting company which was manufactured and used as study aid in further research in aerodynamics of wind turbine blades.</li> 
<li> Development and deployment of standalone applications for predicting hand-off probability of communication systems. Achievement: A MATLAB based software or application was developed for a client in the telecommunications industry.</li>
<li> Data-Driven modeling of gas-fired turbines with application to temperature control using PID and Fuzzy Logic controllers: A case study of Ibom Power Plant. Achievement: Worked as a Research Assistant with a Master student in the development of PID and FLC controllers from data gathered or logged down from live gas turbines, axial compressors and associated combustors.</li>
<li> Design and modeling of Automatic Controlled Irrigation system using Richard’s equation and finite state machines (FSM). Achievement: Developed and designed an automatic controlled irrigation system for rural farmers.</li>
<li> Design and Modelling of Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Using Ambient Air Flow for Wireless Sensor Application. Achievement: Currently working with a PhD student on the development of Piezoelectric Energy Harvester. Research is ongoing.</li> 
<li> Modeling of Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Using Ambient Air Flow for Wireless Sensor Application. Achievement: Designed and modeled piezoelectric energy harvester with ANSYS Electromagnetics and co-simulation with MATLAB and Simulink.</li> 
<li> Design, modeling, control, and analysis of three-phase AC permanent magnet electric motor with various controllers. Achievement: Designed and modeled AC electric motor with ANSYS Electromagnetics, MATLAB and Simulink, and control the same with PID, Fuzzy Logic, Hybrid Fuzzy-PID, Hybrid Fuzzy-PID with Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Hybrid Fuzzy-PID with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) controllers
